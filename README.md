# Demo API

## Project Description

Demo API is a simple project created as my introduction to working with microservices and web applications. It marks the beginning of my journey toward becoming a DevOps engineer. For a long time, microservices were a challenge for me, but this project is designed to help me overcome those barriers and provide a solid foundation for further development.

This project can also serve as an educational resource for those looking to learn the basics of programming and building web applications.

## Frontend

The frontend is simple and includes a step-by-step description of what the application aims to showcase. At the end, it provides tools that interact with the backend's endpoints.

### Technologies used in the frontend:

- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
- **CSS** (using the **Tailwind CSS** framework)

## Backend

The backend of the application is minimalist, offering two endpoints:

1. Serving static files
2. An endpoint that sends text to the appropriate place on the frontend

### Technologies used in the backend:

- **Programming Language**: GO (Golang)
- **Framework**: gin-gonic

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need:

- Installed **GO** (Golang) for the backend
- A web browser that supports **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** for the frontend

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/demo-api.git
